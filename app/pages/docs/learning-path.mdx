Want to get better at developing applications using Blitz, but don't know
where to start? You've come to the right spot.

This document is inspired by the
[Frontend Developer Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend). It curates
material on concepts & ideas, tools & libraries and history & trivia
useful to become better at building applications. It is tailored to Blitz,
but most will easily apply elsewhere.

## todo: missing categories {#missing}

TODO: which categories are missing?

## Testing {#testing}

Automated tests are a great way of verifying that your application works -
and who doesn't want working software?

- TODO: Introduction to the testing pyramid
- TODO: unit testing using Jest
- TODO: writing code to be easily testable
- TODO: cypress guide

## Software Architecture {#architecture}

As your application grows bigger, some structure may be neccessary.
There's a million ways on how to structure your project, here's some good
guidance:

- TODO: a good guide on onion / clearn architecture
- ... TODO: more

## Soft Skills {#soft-skills}

Building software is highly communicative and rarely a solo effort.
Working in a team requires soft skills.

## Building Products {#building-products}

Building a product is more than building an application. Finding the right
business model, evaluating ideas, getting valuable feedback, building a
customer base - all of this is very different from building software. If
you're building a product (there's a fair share of entrepreneurs amongst
Blitz users!), this is for you:
